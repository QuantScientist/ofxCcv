Currently the binary library is only precompiled for for 32-bit and 64-bit OSX (thanks to [Gene Kogan](https://github.com/genekogan)). Additional contributions for face recognition come from [Antimodular Research](https://github.com/antimodular/).

After cloning the repository, you will need to run `./setup.sh` to download the pre-trained ImageNet classifier.
